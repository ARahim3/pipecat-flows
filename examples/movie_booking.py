# Flow Configuration - Movie Booking
#
# This configuration defines a movie ticket booking system with the following states:
#
# 1. start
#    - Initial state where user chooses between today or tomorrow's showings
#    - Functions: check_today, check_tomorrow
#    - Pre-action: Welcome message
#    - Transitions to: check_today or check_tomorrow
#
# 2. check_today
#    - Handles movie selection for today's showings
#    - Functions:
#      * select_movie (node function with today's movies)
#      * select_showtime (node function with available times)
#      * end (transitions to end node after confirmation)
#    - Pre-action: Today's movie listing message
#
# 3. check_tomorrow
#    - Handles movie selection for tomorrow's showings
#    - Functions:
#      * select_movie (node function with tomorrow's movies)
#      * select_showtime (node function with available times)
#      * end (transitions to end node after confirmation)
#    - Pre-action: Tomorrow's movie listing message
#
# 4. end
#    - Final state that closes the conversation
#    - No functions available
#    - Pre-action: Ticket confirmation message
#    - Post-action: Ends conversation
#
# Note: Both check_today and check_tomorrow allow multiple selections
# until the user confirms their final choice
