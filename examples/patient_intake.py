# Flow Configuration - Patient Intake
#
# This configuration defines a medical intake system with the following states:
#
# 1. start
#    - Initial state where system verifies patient identity through birthday
#    - Functions:
#      * verify_birthday (node function to check DOB)
#      * get_prescriptions (transitions to prescription collection)
#    - Pre-action: Initial greeting from Jessica
#    - Expected flow: Greet -> Ask DOB -> Verify -> Transition to prescriptions
#
# 2. get_prescriptions
#    - Collects information about patient's current medications
#    - Functions:
#      * record_prescriptions (node function, collects medication name and dosage)
#      * get_allergies (transitions to allergy collection)
#    - Expected flow: Ask about prescriptions -> Record details -> Transition to allergies
#
# 3. get_allergies
#    - Collects information about patient's allergies
#    - Functions:
#      * record_allergies (node function, records allergy information)
#      * get_conditions (transitions to medical conditions)
#    - Expected flow: Ask about allergies -> Record details -> Transition to conditions
#
# 4. get_conditions
#    - Collects information about patient's medical conditions
#    - Functions:
#      * record_conditions (node function, records medical conditions)
#      * get_visit_reasons (transitions to visit reason collection)
#    - Expected flow: Ask about conditions -> Record details -> Transition to visit reasons
#
# 5. get_visit_reasons
#    - Collects information about why patient is visiting
#    - Functions:
#      * record_visit_reasons (node function, records visit reasons)
#      * verify_information (transitions to verification)
#    - Expected flow: Ask about visit reason -> Record details -> Transition to verification
#
# 6. verify_information
#    - Reviews all collected information with patient
#    - Functions:
#      * get_prescriptions (returns to prescriptions if changes needed)
#      * end (transitions to end after confirmation)
#    - Expected flow: Review all info -> Confirm accuracy -> End or revise
#
# 7. end
#    - Final state that closes the conversation
#    - No functions available
#    - Pre-action: Thank you message
#    - Post-action: Ends conversation
